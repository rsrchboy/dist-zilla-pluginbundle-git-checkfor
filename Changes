Revision history for Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Git-CheckFor

{{$NEXT}}

0.003     2012-05-02 11:11:39 America/Los_Angeles
- handle version tags where '-TRIAL' is appeneded.  We'll need to revisit this
  later to make things Work Better, but for now it works and with a minimum of
  fuss.

0.002     2012-04-13 14:16:08 America/Los_Angeles
- no functional changes!
- bump Test::Moose::More prereq to 0.008, as we need a version of
  has_attribute_ok that handles checking roles w/o barfing (as Test::Moose now
  seems to)
